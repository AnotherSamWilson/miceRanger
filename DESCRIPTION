Description: Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations 
  (also known as fully conditional specification) with 
  random forests. Multiple Imputation has been shown to 
  be a flexible method to impute missing values (Van 
  Buuren, S. 2007a). Expanding on this, random forests 
  have been shown to be an accurate model (Stekhoven and 
  Buhlmann, 2012) to impute missing values in datasets. 
  They have the added benefits of returning out of bag 
  error and variable importance estimates, as well as 
  being simple to run in parallel.
