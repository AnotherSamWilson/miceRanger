Description: This package performs Multiple Imputation by Chained 
  Equations (also known as fully conditional specification) with 
  random forests. Multiple Imputation has been shown to be a flexible 
  method to impute missing values (Van Buuren, S. 2007a). Expanding on this,
  random forests have been shown to be an accurate model (Stekhoven and Buhlmann, 2012) 
  to impute missing values in datasets. They have the added benefits of
  returning OOB error and variable importance estimates, as well as being trivially
  parallelizable.
